# Nacms: Handle directory index
#
#  1. Shows common index files instead of a directory listing
#  2. If none found, adds `index.md` so this will be shown if it exists.
#  3. If no valid index found, show folder listing with `folder-handler.php`
#
# If the script is somewhere other than the folder `.nacms` in the same folders
# as this file, edit the path to match.
# Path is from the root public folder.
